# Capstone Final Project

Files used for Typological Comparison Experiments in Morphosyntactic Alignment

Experiments were designed by Nick Hankins and advised by Dr. Anna Feldman at Montclair State University.

The changes that were made to the code, the jupyter notebooks used to filter data and plot data, and the experiments associated with them are all explained in my master's capstone paper.

Feel free to reach out with any questions at nicholasjhankins@gmail.com. 
There will be more adjustments made soon to expand on the current state of the project such as the verifying the test data selections.

The majority of code involved in the classifier training used here was from this project (https://github.com/toizzy/deep-subjecthood) as a starting point and as inspiration.
